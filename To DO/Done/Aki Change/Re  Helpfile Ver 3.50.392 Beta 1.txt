I found one thing to be changed in UDP BandMap. The Red text below should me removed.

Logging QSO

 

When QSO is logged in JTDX/WSJT-X this QSO is logged directly in Logger32. You should notice the difference between JTDX and WSJT-X:

 

If you use JTDX you need no mouse clicking. The QSO is logged automatically in Logger32;

 

If you use WSJT-X you need to click “OK” in the WSJT-X logging window in order to log the QSO in WSJT-X and Logger32;

 

The “OK” and “Cancel” buttons appears here and there.

 

If you use WSJT-X you see the WSJT-X logging window for a second when the QSO is logged in WSJT-X, then this QSO is logged automatically in Logger32.

 

TIME_ON is not correctly logged if you use “Skip Tx1 enabled” in WSJT-X. This is a known issue in WSJT-X.

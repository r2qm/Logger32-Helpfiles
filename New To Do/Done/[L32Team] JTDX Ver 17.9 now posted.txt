Version 17.9 of JTDX is now publicly available at:

     JTDX

	
JTDX
JTDX - HAM program for HF JT65 and JT9 modes
	

I think this link can be used as the reference following TCPS_1. In addition the statement following beginning The following site is to download the last Beta version ... and the associated link is no longer needed.

Aki are you okay with this change?

73,

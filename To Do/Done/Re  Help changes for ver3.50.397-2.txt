            I need a new one Aki if you could. It would make it much easier to edit the HTML files.

                OK

                 

                Now I understand what is wrong.

                 

                These document is written using LibreOffice. It looks OK of course.

                However if this document is opened with WPS writer then pictures are placed wrongly.

                 

                So this is one of compatibility problem.

                Previously document is written with WPS. I thought there were no problem.

                 

                If you need revised document then I will edited again with WPS writer. Your comment please.

                    LBEW_3A display is messed up ???

                     

                    Par 3.0 is also messed   up

                     

                    Looks like pictures are placed among the text.

Aki,

I am not familiar with Flex radio and setup. We primarily depend on user input.

 

Help file:

Since this is an external interface, I would  suggest we make a new main section and move some existing MISC  topics to the new section.

 

Something Like this:

 

+   External Interface

·          Using the Logger32 External Interface

·         The TCP Server

·         The UDP Bandmap

·         UDP broadcast of DX Spots

·         The TCP Server

·         Support for Ham Cap

·         Utilities

I know it is still under developing and testing.

I think we should make new section for this new feature.

My suggestion is to make new "UDP broadcast of DX spots" topic under Misc

or add some explanation in existing DX spot window.

 

Jim

Are you familiar to Flex Radio ?  This seems to work only together with Flex Radio

and SliceMaster.

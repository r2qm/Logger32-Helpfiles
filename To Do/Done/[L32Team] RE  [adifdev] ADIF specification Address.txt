Thanks Graham,

The direct link was what I needed: ( http://adif.org.uk/adif )

I guess I was asleep at the wheel when you set this up.

Thanks for the prompt response.

Hello Jim and Jamie.

Yikes!!  The latest released version isn’t 3.0.4, it’s 3.0.5:
http://adif.org.uk/305/ADIF_305.htm

Dave AA6YQ mentioned the exact same thing some weeks ago, so I set up a link that will always redirect to the latest released version:
http://adif.org.uk/adif

(In my defence, this is mentioned on the home page: http://adif.org.uk – HI.)

I like the idea...

Maybe /latest.htm or just /adif.htm could be a link to the latest version...

    Graham,

    The current approved specification is located at “http://adif.org.uk/304/ADIF_304.htm”.

    This is fine, however, Is there a permanent URL address where a user can always download the latest approved spec?

     We need a stable address that does not change when a new version is approved.

    We would like to include  a fixed reference in the Logger Help file.

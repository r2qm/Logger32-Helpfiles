For the latest help file, Go to;

 

https://github.com/VA7HU/Logger32-Helpfiles/releases

 

Download  “Logger32.chm” and copy it to the Logger32 folder

Select it with a right click, and select Properties, check “unlock” and apply.

You can now open the file direct or via help with Logger32 running.

Hi Jim,

A little different subject.  I need a Logger32 searchable manual.  Can you show me where I can download that?  It is too difficult to find things in a PDF manual.

    Hi Herb,

    I’m glad you got it going. Be sure and let it auto-update to ver 3.50.411.

    I wish you luck on getting WSJT interfaced.

    I prefer JTDX. It seems to provides a better interface with Logger32.

    Jim,

     

    At last !  I got Logger32 full 350 installed.  All my previously entered QSOs were intact, as well as the backups I had done.  Now, I am practicing the manual processes I am rusty on, and am about to get a bunch of recent ft8 QSOs automatically entered from WSJT-X storage.

     

    Thank you for all your directions and advice, not to mention a lot of patience for my need to ask questions about things I was unfamiliar to.

     

    I am not leaving the Logger group, but since it generates a lot of email, I intend to change my group email to another email.

     

    73,

    Herb Slade AA2BF

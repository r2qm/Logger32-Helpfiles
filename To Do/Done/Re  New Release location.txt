OK, will do.

I remember recently a new Beta Tester was added to the Beta team. I was going to add it to the list in the Helpfile but I can't seem to find the email with his name and call. Can you remember who it was ?

Also, we are up at the trailer so I don;t know what the current update version # is.

    When you are ready, just ask Prasad to change the “Logger32.net | English help file” link to the new GitHub address.

    He will let you know when he makes the change and you can verify everything is working.

    His e-mail is: (VU2PTT@GMAIL.COM)

    Will do, but it is the new "GITHUB" info that he needs, not the old Codeplex stuff !!!

    What is his email address ?

        Prasad uses the same link that we do for the English help file.

        I sent him the Codeplex info. When all is ok just send him the new link.
